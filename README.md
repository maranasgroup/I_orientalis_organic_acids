# _I. orientalis_ organic acids
This repository includes simulations of _Issatchenkia orientalis_ producing organic acids.

# Description
These files require a genome-scale metabolic (GSM) model of _Issatchenkia orientalis_ to run, which can be found
in the separate repository, https://github.com/maranasgroup/iIsor_memote as an SBML file.

# Manuscript Supplementary Materials
Files specifically associated with publications are located in the [``Manuscript Supplementary Materials`` directory](Manuscript%20Supplementary%20Materials). Please see the appropriate publication directory for details about the manuscripts.
